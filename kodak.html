              <br>City Directories and Brain Drain in Rochester, NY
            </h2>
            <p>
              This project uses a custom-tailored OCR pipeline for the image processing
              and text extraction of digitized city directories published by R.L. Polk & Co. from 1879 to 2010.
              <br>
            </p>
            <h3>
              <br>My Role
            </h3>
            <p>
              I built the OCR pipeline, performed the text extraction, geocoding, and data analysis. I am a coauthor
              on a paper currently seeking to answer two questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the effect of social proximity on entrepreneurship?</li>
                <li>How do innovators respond to the threat of losing their jobs?</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
            The latter asks how the expectation of being laid off influences some inventors' (patent holders)
              decision to start their own business, retire, substitute employment for a similar tech job,
              or move completely from the area, which then measures a level of brain drain resulting from the crash of
            Eastman Kodak in the 1990s.
              <br>
              <br>Below describes the data and OCR pipeline I built for this project.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <br>Data
            </h3>
            <p>
              We have a collection of scanned city directories published by R.L. Polk from the late 1800s to the first decade of the 2000s. These records are important
              because they have individual-level
              occupation/position and employer data in addition to the home address. Below shows the sort
              of data one would find on these pages: </p>

              <img src="./img/Alphabeticals.jpg" alt="Directory Data Description " class="pipeline">
              <p>
              <br><br>The current study divides the data into two categories: <b>Business</b> and <b>Alphabetical</b> directories.

              <b>Alphabetical</b> directories are organized by last name and are not exclusively residential listings.

            <br>Zinco has been tested and validated on the R.L. Polk & Co. directories from 1879 to 2010 in the Rochester,
              NY area, with
            some testing on Greensborough NC. These directories are normally found in public libraries and are still
              being published.
              <br><br> My program, <b>Zinco</b>, is built to read and compile information contained in these images
              and save them to a centralized, queryable database. To date, I have compiled over 2 million records from
              the Rochester, NY area for just the 1990s and am currently compiling more from outside that window.
              While OCR'd city directories are not new, most are products of outdated OCR technology and
              are of questionable accuracy or formatting (usually a plain text file of sparse text and no delineation of
              field or order). <i> We are unaware of any other database in the academic or genealogical communities that contains the
              precision and breadth of this database.</i> </p>
               <h3>
              <br> Pipeline
            </h3>
            <p> With the help of historians and FamilySearch volunteers, these records are scanned and saved into
              digital directories. This is an example of page from the 1990 Rochester, NY suburban directory:
            </p>

            <img src="./img/1990_ROC_SUB_EX.jpg" alt="1990 Rochester City Directory" class="pipeline">
            <p>
              <b>Zinco</b> works in three ways: preprocessing, OCR, and postprocessing, which I otherwise call parsing.
              The preprocessing step uses computer vision to make the image and readable as possible for the OCR, which
              reads and saves the text in a tabular form (rather than plain text).
              The postprocessing step then applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse the data from the directory
              into its respective fields, as shown below.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pretty neat, huh?
            </p>

            <p><br>Now that we have a cross-section of people with addresses extracted from their directory entry,
              we can take this process a step further and think about plotting the addresses of specific Kodak executives
              or employees, and boom! We have a map of the social and professional networks of Kodak employees in Rochester, NY.
              <br><br>Of course, this is an extremely simplified way to explain a rather complicated process. Below is a
              a more detailed workflow diagram of this part of the pipeline.
