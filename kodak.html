              <br>City Directories and Brain Drain in Rochester, NY
            </h2>
            <p>
              This project uses a custom-tailored OCR pipeline for the image processing
              and text extraction of digitized city directories published by R.L. Polk & Co. from 1879 to 2010.

            <h3>
              <br>My Role
            </h3>
            <p>
              I built the OCR pipeline, performed the text extraction, geocoding, and data analysis. I am a coauthor
              on a paper currently seeking to answer two questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the effect of social proximity on entrepreneurship?</li>
                <li>How do innovators respond to the threat of losing their jobs?</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
            The latter asks how the expectation of being laid off influences some inventors' (patent holders)
              decision to start their own business, retire, substitute employment for a similar tech job,
              or move completely from the area, which then measures a level of brain drain resulting from the crash of
            Eastman Kodak in the 1990s.
              <br>
              <br>Below describes the data and OCR pipeline I built for this project.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <br>Data
            </h3>
            <p>
              We have a collection of scanned city directories published by R.L. Polk from the late 1800s to the first decade of the 2000s. These records are important
              because they have individual-level
              occupation/position and employer data in addition to the home address.
              <br><br>The current study divides the data into two categories: <b>Business</b> and <b>Alphabetical</b> directories.

              <b>Alphabetical</b> directories are organized by last name and are not exclusively residential listings.

            <br>Zinco has been tested and validated on the R.L. Polk & Co. directories from 1879 to 2010 in the Rochester,
              NY area, with
            some testing on Greensborough NC. These directories are normally found in public libraries and are still
              being published.
