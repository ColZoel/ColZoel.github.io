            <p>
              Originally from Casper, Wyoming, I graduated from Brigham Young University with a B.S. in economics in 2023
              where I served as the head computer vision developer at the
              <a href="https://record-linking-lab.byu.edu/"> Record Linking Lab</a>
              at Brigham Young University. I led a team of 5-9 developers in building CV tools for genealogy.
              <br><br> Working with
              collaborators and clients such as FamilySearch, World Archives, the Wilford Woodruff Papers Foundation,
              and researchers from many notable universities, we leveraged custom BYU handwriting recognition models
              and segmentation classifiers to build a pipeline
              that inputs grid images (e.g. census records) and outputs a CSV transcription.
              I have presented at several conferences, including the BYU Family History Technology
              Workshop, and the exclusive President's Leadership Council, which is an annual event for the top 1% of
              BYU donors.

            <br><br>Current projects include a collaboration with Harvard Business School PhD candidate,
              Jonathan Palmer, in which I leverage BYU and open-source OCR tools to build a pipeline that inputs a
              directory of
              images of scanned city directories and outputs a tabular transcription. It then geocodes, maps, and
              then applies ML and spatial econometrics
              to get a sense of changes in professional networks, the propensity for entrepreneurship, and the overall
              impact of the Kodak crash on the economy in Rochester, New York. You can learn more about the project on
              the <a href="./research.html">Research page</a>.

            <br><br> Being entirely self-taught, I developed my technical skills from osmosis through my programmers,
              YouTube tutorials, online communities such as Stack Overflow, and a library of books
              I have accumulated on Python, machine learning, and data science. I have never taken formal coursework
              in computer science, but I am active in the international ML community.
              <br><br>
              At BYU, I was a vocal percussionist (beatboxer) in the BYU premier co-ed a cappella group, 1AChord,
              a member of the Honors Program, and am still a Pickleball fiend.
              From 2017â€“2019 served as a volunteer missionary for the Church of Jesus
              Christ of Latter-day Saints in the East Lost Angeles area, where I developed a love for Spanish and
              Latin American literature and an empathy for the plight of many migrants and refugees in the United
              States. I am ACTFL certified fluent in Spanish.
