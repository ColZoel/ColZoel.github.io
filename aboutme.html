            <p>
              Originally from Casper, Wyoming, I graduated from Brigham Young University with a B.S. in economics in 2023
              where I served as the head computer vision developer at the
              <a href="https://record-linking-lab.byu.edu/"> Record Linking Lab</a>
              . I led a team of 5-9 developers in building CV tools for genealogy. These generally consisted of automatic
              census transcription and handwriting recognition.
              <br><br> Working with
              collaborators and clients such as FamilySearch, World Archives, the Wilford Woodruff Papers Foundation,
              and researchers from many notable universities, we leveraged custom BYU handwriting recognition models
              and segmentation classifiers to build a pipeline
              that inputs grid images (e.g. census records) and outputs a CSV transcription.
              I have presented at several conferences, including the BYU Family History Technology
              Workshop and the exclusive President's Leadership Council, which is an annual event for the top 1% of
              BYU donors.

              <br><br>At Carnegie Mellon, I work with Matthew Denes (CMU), Spyridon Lagaras (University of Pittsburgh),
              and Margarita Tsoutsoura (Washington University at St. Louis) in conjunction with the Research and Applied
              Statistics Office at the Internal Revenue Service on several
              projects that utilize big administrative tax data. These include a study on the impact of the timing of
              government support on firms, and another on the impact of the gig economy on entrepreneurship.

              <br><br>With an avid interest in emerging technology, I have a passion for pushing the current frontiers
              of economics. I am particularly interested in the applications of machine learning and have recently been
              investigating the potential of quantum machine learning in economics and finance.
              My time at CMU grants me the opportunity to enhance my self-study with the world's best courses in ML
              and computer science from some of the biggest names in the field, including the famous 10-601 ML course
              and quantum machine learning.


              <br><br>Past projects include a collaboration with Harvard Business School PhD candidate,
              Jonathan Palmer, in which I leverage BYU and open-source OCR tools to build an ML pipline
              to get a sense of changes in professional networks, the propensity for entrepreneurship, and the overall
              impact of the Kodak crash on the economy in Rochester, New York. You can learn more about the project
              <a href="./kodak.html">here</a>.

              <br><br>I am proficient in Stata, Python, CSS and HTML, SQL, and Linux, and am familiar with R and Matlab.
              I have a number of ML and economics projects available on GitHub, including a Python package that
              wraps the PyStata API for Stata for easier interaction, implementation, and native parallelization of
              Stata processes via Python. I have experience with various cloud platforms, including Amazon AWS and
              the Google Developer SDK, and am familiar with various classical and quantum mathematical programming
              software, including the Gurobi simplex solver, IBM's Qiskit, and the D-Wave Ocean SDK.

              <br><br>
              At BYU, I was a vocal percussionist (beatboxer) in the BYU premier co-ed a cappella group, 1AChord,
              a member of the Honors Program, and am still a Pickleball fiend.
              From 2017 to 2019 I served as a volunteer missionary for the Church of Jesus
              Christ of Latter-day Saints in the East Lost Angeles area, where I developed a love for Spanish and
              Latin American literature and an empathy for the plight of many migrants and refugees in the United
              States, which I expect this to be the topic of many of my future projects.
              I am ACTFL certified fluent in Spanish and volunteer 3-5 hours each week teaching English to
              Spanish speakers.
