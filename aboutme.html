            <p>
            Originally from Casper, Wyoming, I graduated from Brigham Young University with a B.S. in economics in 2023. In addtion to
            economics, I have a passion for data science, latin american culture and literature, and the policy implications of
            the intersection of these fields.

            <br><br>Before my current positions as a pre-doctoral research associate at the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/">
            Tepper School of Business
            at Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I was the lead computer vision developer at the Record Linking Lab at
            Brigham Young University where I led a team of 5-9 developers in building CV tools for genealogy. We leveraged
            custom BYU handwriting recognition models and segmentation classifiers to build a pipeline that inputs
            grid images (such as census records) and outputs a csv transcription. We worked with such collaborators
            and clients as FamilySearch, World Archives, the Wilford Woodruff Foundation, and researchers from
            Notre Dame, Stanford, and Duke, among others. In this capacity I have presented at a number of conferences
            including the BYU Family History Technology Workshop, and the exclusive President's Leadership Council, which
            is an annual event for the top 1% of BYU donors.

            <br><br>I also work as a research assistant and coauthor for Harvard Business School PhD candidate,
            Jonathan Palmer.
            I leverage BYU and open source OCR tools to build a pipeline that inputs a directory of
            images of scanned city directories and outputs a tabular transcription, geocodes, maps, and analyzes data to
            get a sense of changes in professional networks, the propensity for entrepreneurship, and the overall impact
            of the Kodak crash on the economy in Rochester, New York. You can learn more about the project on the Research
            page.

            <br><br>Amazingly, I have never taken course work related to computer science. Being entirely self-taught,
            I developed my technical skills from osmosis through those on my development team, YouTube tutorials, online communities
            such as Stack Overflow, and a library of books I have accumulated on Python, machine learning, and data science.

            <br><br> At BYU, I was also a vocal percussionist (beatboxer) in the BYU a cappella group, 1AChord, a
            member of the Honors Program, and overall food conoisseur. Prior to BYU, I served as a volunteer missionary
            for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the East Lost Angeles area, where I learned Spanish,
            developed a love for latin american culture and literature, as well as an empathy for the plight of many
            migrants and refugees in the United States. I am ACTFL certified fluent in Spanish.
